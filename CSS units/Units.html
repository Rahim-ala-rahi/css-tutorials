<div style="width: 50vw;">This element has a width of 50% of the viewport width.</div>

<!-- Percentage Units: -->

<!-- Absolute units :: are CSS length units that are fixed and do not change based on the context of the element. They are based on physical measurements such as inches, centimeters, or pixels.

The most commonly used absolute unit in CSS is the pixel (px), which represents a single dot on a computer screen. The size of a pixel is not standardized and can vary depending on the device and screen resolution.

Other absolute units include inches (in), centimeters (cm), millimeters (mm), picas (pc), and points (pt). These units are often used in print stylesheets, where physical measurements are important for specifying the size and layout of a printed document.

Absolute units are useful for specifying exact dimensions and positioning in CSS, but they can be problematic for responsive design because they do not adapt to different screen sizes or zoom levels. For this reason, relative units like em and rem are often preferred in web design. -->


<!-- Relative units :: are CSS length units that are based on the size or context of another element, rather than on fixed, physical measurements. They are useful for creating flexible and responsive layouts that can adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

There are several relative units in CSS, including:

em: This unit is based on the font size of the current element. For example, if the font size of an element is 16px, 1em would be equal to 16px. If the font size of a parent element is used, the em unit will be relative to the parent element's font size.

rem: This unit is similar to the em unit, but it is based on the font size of the root element (typically the <html> element). This makes it easier to create consistent, scalable layouts across an entire website.

vw: This unit is based on the width of the viewport (the visible area of the browser window). 1vw represents 1% of the viewport width.

vh: This unit is similar to vw, but it is based on the viewport height instead of width.

%: This unit is also based on the size of another element. For example, if the width of a parent element is 100px and an element within it has a width of 50%, it would have a width of 50px.

Relative units are particularly useful for creating responsive designs that can adapt to different screen sizes and devices. By using relative units, you can ensure that your layout and typography scale appropriately and maintain a consistent visual hierarchy across different devices. -->
