<!-- In CSS, "vw" stands for viewport width. It is a unit of measurement that represents a percentage of the width of the viewport (the visible portion of the browser window).

For example, if the viewport width is 1000 pixels and you set an element's width to 50vw, the element's width will be 500 pixels.

Using vw units can be useful for creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes, as it allows you to specify sizes relative to the viewport rather than fixed pixel values. -->

<!-- In this example, we have a container div with a width of 80vw, which means it will be 80% of the width of the viewport. We've also given it a lightblue background color and centered it horizontally using margin: 0 auto.

Inside the container, we have a box div with a width and height of 50vw, which means it will be a square that is 50% of the width of the viewport. We've given it a coral background color, centered it horizontally using margin: 0 auto, and added a margin-top of 50px to give it some space from the text above.

You can try resizing the browser window to see how the box size and container width respond to changes in viewport width. -->
