<!-- The CSS border-radius property sets the rounded corners of an element's border.

In the code border-radius: 0 0 20px 0;, the values correspond to the radius of each corner, starting from the top-left corner and moving clockwise around the element.

The first value, 0, sets the radius for the top-left corner to 0 pixels, which means it will have a sharp corner.

The second value, 0, sets the radius for the top-right corner to 0 pixels, which means it will also have a sharp corner.

The third value, 20px, sets the radius for the bottom-right corner to 20 pixels, which means it will be rounded.

The fourth value, 0, sets the radius for the bottom-left corner to 0 pixels, which means it will have a sharp corner.

So, with this code, the element will have a sharp top-left and top-right corner, and a rounded bottom-right corner, and a sharp bottom-left corner. -->
